# Fathym Habistack Forecast API Pricing FAQ

**CAN I PAY MONTHLY?**

Yes, plans are charged monthly or yearly. 

**IS THERE A DISCOUNT FOR PAYING ANNUALLY VERSUS MONTHLY?**

Yes, if you pay for the year in advance, you get two months for free. If you pay for a lower priced plan for a year and choose to upgrade, any amounts previously paid will be credited toward your upgrade. 

**CAN I UPGRADE FROM ONE PLAN TO ANOTHER AT ANY TIME?**

Yes, just select your preferred plan in your billing page.  

**ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL CHARGES?**

No, although if you want custom enterprise packages or custom machine learning data variables, contact our Sales team <a href="mailto:sales@fathym.com">sales@fathym.com</a>.

**WHAT SUPPORT DOES FATHYM OFFER?**

Fathym offers extensive documentation to guide users through the Habistack API. Customers can also contact support staff who will respond within 24 hours on weekdays.

**WHAT DO WE MEAN BY API CALL?**

An API call is any time you pull content from the API. 

**WHAT DO WE MEAN BY POINT QUERY?**

A typical API request is for forecasts of variables at points (in space and time). A point is any geo-location at a specific time in the future; so, for instance, a route can be represented as a series of points. Variables are any available forecast data, such as air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, road temperature, road condition, delay risk and more.

**WHAT DO WE MEAN BY DATA VARIABLES?**

Data Variables are derived using proprietary machine learning algorithms.

**WHAT CUSTOM DATA VARIABLES DOES FATHYM CURRENTLY OFFER?**

Fathym offers the following custom data variables:

-- **Weather Delay Risk**: a data variable that calculates the risk of road weather on ETAs.  
-- **Surface / Road State**: a data variable forecasting the conditions on the ground or road.  
-- **Surface / Road Temperature**: a data variable calculating the temperature of the ground or road, rather than the ambient temperature above.

**DOES FATHYM HAVE A WAY TO VISUALIZE THE WEATHER DATA?**

With a license to the Fathym Low Code Framework, you can access the Fathym Habistack Low-Code Unit and a suite of tools to help you visualize custom solutions.

-- Fathym Forecast Module: a visual interface to determine the weather and surface condition forecast along primary and secondary routes. This module calls the Fathym Habistack Forecast API.

For an example of how you can visualize weather data, please check out https://www.proadject.com/.

That data application was built using Fathymâ€™s low-code framework. Fathym has made some of these resources open source for your use. Check out the GitHub repository at https://github.com/habistack/lcu-fathym-forecast.
